Instructions: 

   We are uploading 6 files contains test cases 0 to 5. The files are contained in the tar 
   archive "input-assgn5.tar.gz".
   
   For example, to run your program on test case 3, run the following command on your terminal:
  
   ./a.out <in3

   I am assuming that the name of your executable is "a.out".
 
   The "<" operator in Linux takes the input for a program from the filename specified after it,
   instead of taking input from the keyboard.

   IMPORTANT: Note that at any point of time, there may be many possible shortest paths available to the robot.
              The behaviour of Stentz's algorithm depends on the shortest path you choose at each step. 
              Therefore, the path traced by the robot may be different for different implementations.
               
              We will check your programs by giving your output to a ``checker", which will verify whether
              the behaviour of your robot is consistent with the algorithm. Therefore, you should EXACTLY
              follow the output format described below.

	      We are giving an executable ``checker" with this tar archive. It can be used to check whether the
              output of your program is correct. For example, to check your program on in5, first save the
              output to a file, say out5.
            
              Then, run the following command:

	      ./checker in5 <out5

              Note that the input in5 and output out 5 must be in the same directory as the checker.
              The checker will output "Correct" or "Incorrect" based on whether your algorithm gives the correct
              output or not. 

              Your program outputs will be checked in the above manner. Make sure you adhere to the output
              format described in the assignment handout. Also, the executable may not run on your computer, as it
              was compiled on my machine.
